      Object tracking has long been an established area of research in computer vision.
 The objective is to identify objects in a video and track their location while maintaining 
 a given identity for the duration of their visibility. Applications can be found in many practical areas,

      The objective was to write software that can be used for scientific purposes. 
The idea was that different stimuli could be loaded into a UI (here called “Experiment Designer”), 
and these stimuli are then correctly classified and subsequently correctly merged into a list. 
It is then possible to customize the stimuli, such as the initial camera rotation for 360-degree videos or
 how long an im...
