The objective was to write software that can be used for scientific purposes. 
The idea was that different stimuli could be loaded into a UI (here called "Experiment Designer"), 
and these stimuli are then correctly classified and subsequently correctly merged into a list. 
It is then possible to customize the stimuli, such as the initial camera rotation for 360-degree videos or
 how long an image should be displayed before it automatically disappears for the subject. Further functions,
 such as saving and loading such a list of stimuli to have them quickly ready again with the same adjusted 
 values, have also been integrated. Afterward, it is possible to automatically run through the list of stimuli 
 via a button in the Experiment Designer. Of course, it is still possible to pause the playback, skip stimuli, 
 or play them again, and stop the playback at an early stage. During the playback process, the eyes are tracked 
 to trace the origin and direction of the gaze, always relative to the head movement, and to automatically write
 it down in a separate text file so that this data can be analyzed afterward.
